<h1>Essential Tips, Tricks, and Rules for Using Modals</h1>

<h2>What Are Modals?</h2>
<p>Modals (or modal auxiliary verbs) are special verbs used with the base form of a main verb to express possibility, ability, permission, advice, obligation, and more. Examples: <strong>can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, would, ought to.</strong></p>

<h2>Golden Rules for Using Modals</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Never Add “-s” With He/She/It:</strong> Modals never change for the subject. It’s always “he can”, “she will”, “it should” (never “cans”, “wills”, or “shoulds”).</li>
  <li><strong>Always Use the Base Form of the Main Verb After a Modal:</strong> No “to” and no “-ing”.<br>
    Correct: “She might go.”<br>
    Incorrect: “She might to go.” / “She might goes.”</li>
  <li><strong>No Double Modals:</strong> Never use two modals together.<br>
    Wrong: “He should must come.”</li>
  <li><strong>No Change for Tense/Subject:</strong> Modal verbs themselves don’t take the past or present tense except for “could” and “would”, which serve as the past forms of “can” and “will”.</li>
  <li><strong>Making Negatives:</strong> Just add “not” after the modal:<br>
    “I cannot (can’t) swim.”<br>
    “He should not (shouldn’t) speak.”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tricks to Identify Correct Modal for the Sentence</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ask: Is it about ability? (use “can/could”); Permission? (“can/may/could” depending on formality); Advice? (“should/ought to”); Obligation? (“must/have to”).</li>
  <li>Check Tone & Formality: Use “may” for formal permission, “can” for casual.</li>
  <li>For advice, use “should” or “ought to”; for strong necessity, use “must”.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Form Questions</h2>
<p><strong>Structure:</strong> [Modal] + [subject] + [base verb]</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Can you help me?”</li>
  <li>“Should I stay?”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Handy Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t use “to” after modals (except with “ought to”):<br>
  Wrong: “You must to leave.”<br>
  Right: “You must leave.”</li>
  <li>Modals for Past:<br>
  Use “could, would, might, should have + past participle” for hypothetical/past:<br>
  “He could have won.”<br>
  “You should have called.”</li>
  <li>Modal Negatives:<br>
  “Cannot” (can’t), “should not” (shouldn’t), “must not” (mustn’t), etc.</li>
  <li>Watch for Common Traps:<br>
  Don’t say: “She cans sing.”<br>
  Don’t use double modals: “He must should go.”<br>
  Always use the base verb: “She can dance.” not “She can dancing.”</li>
</ul>
