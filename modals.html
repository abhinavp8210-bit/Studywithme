        <h2>What are Modal Verbs?</h2>
        <p>Modal verbs are helper verbs that express ability, possibility, permission, necessity, or advice. Common modals include: <strong>can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, would.</strong></p>
        
        <h2>Tips and Tricks for Modal Verbs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No 's' ending for modals:</strong> Modal verbs never change form for he, she, or it.<br>
                ✅ Correct: She can go. He should study.<br>
                ❌ Incorrect: She cans go. He shoulds study.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Modal + base verb (without ‘to’):</strong> Always use the base form of the verb after a modal verb.<br>
                ✅ Correct: I can swim. You should try.<br>
                ❗ Exception: Use ‘to’ only with <code>ought to</code> and <code>have to</code>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Making negatives:</strong> Add <code>not</code> directly after the modal.<br>
                ✅ She should not go.<br>
                ✅ He cannot play.<br>
                Contracted forms: shouldn’t, can’t, won’t.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Questions with modals:</strong> Structure → Modal + subject + base verb.<br>
                Example: Can you help? Should she come?
            </li>
            <li><strong>Past modal forms:</strong> Use modal + have + past participle for past possibilities or regrets.<br>
                Example: She should have studied harder. He could have won the race.
            </li>
        </ul>
